# horiseon-refactor
My refactoring of the Horiseon Website.

## Description

For this project I set out to refactor the HTML and CSS for Horiseon's website in order to maximize accesibility for users, search engines, and other developers.  

This website was refactored so that the items in the nav bar properly link to the corresponding sections in the webpage below, the images have alt attributes, and the HTML has been restructured using semantic tags for better search engine optimization. Several redundant tags, classes, and id's were removed in favor of cleaner, more concise code.

The CSS styles have also been consolidated and reordered to follow CSS conventions.

## Deployed Page and Code

The website is viewable at https://gregriss.github.io/horiseon-refactor/
and the code is viewable at https://github.com/gregriss/horiseon-refactor.git 

## Usage

Horiseon's website is simple and intuitive to use. Simply click an item in the nav bar in the top right of the page to access the corresponding section of the site.

Here is a screenshot of the deployed page:
